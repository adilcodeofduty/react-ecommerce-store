## 🔌 API

Product information is loaded from the DummyJSON Products API.

**API:**

```text
https://dummyjson.com/products
```

The application uses API data for:

- Product listing
- Product images
- Product title
- Product price
- Product rating
- Product category
- Product description
- Product details
- Related product sections

---

## 🛒 Cart Management

The cart is managed using **React Context API**.

### Cart flow

```text
Product
   ↓
Add to Cart
   ↓
CartContext
   ↓
Cart Items
   ↓
Cart Drawer
```

If a product already exists in the cart, another click on **Add to
Cart** does not create a duplicate item.

Products can also be removed completely from the cart.

---

## 💾 Cart Persistence

Cart data is stored in browser `localStorage`.

```text
Add Product
     ↓
Cart Context
     ↓
localStorage
     ↓
Refresh Browser
     ↓
Cart Restored
```

This allows the cart to remain available after refreshing the page.
